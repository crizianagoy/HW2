    I want to integrate the Gaussian probability density function between
    a left hand limit = (mean - 5*stDev) to a right hand limit = (c).  Here
    is my step-by-step plan:
    1. Decide mean, stDev, and c and if I want P(x>c) or P(x<c).
    2. Define args tuple and c to be passed to Probability
    3. Pass args, and a callback function (GPDF) to Probability
    4. In probability, pass along GPDF to Simpson along with the appropriate args tuple
    5. Return the required probability from Probability and print to screen.
    :return: Nothing to return, just print results to screen.
